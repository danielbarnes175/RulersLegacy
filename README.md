## Build

To build the project, the following prerequisites are needed:

- NodeJS (and NPM)
- The [Expo](https://expo.dev/) app on Android or iOS
- Git

1. Open a terminal and clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/danielbarnes175/RulersLegacy.git` (You can also do this via a fork)
2. `cd RulersLegacy`
3. `npm install`
4. `ipconfig` and note the `IPv4 Address`
5. `npm run start`
6. In a web browser on your mobile device, navigate to `exp://your_IPv4_Address:19000`, it should prompt you to open your expo app.
7. The app should download and load within the Expo app. More usage instructions for Expo can be found on their documentation, but a useful one is to shake your mobile device to bring up the Dev menu where you can reload the app, and toggle various developer tools.
